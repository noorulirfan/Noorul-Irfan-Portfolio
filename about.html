        <p class="p1 a1">As a very small child I don’t remember that much, but the things that I do remember were seen through a child’s eyes that has made me the person that I am today and I will always have those memory’s with me until my last breath on this earth.Everyone has a different life journey from others.</p>
        <p class="p1 a2">In that journey itself, we generally experienced either happy or sad moments because life is like a Rollercoaster. Sometimes we were feeling up, and there was time we will be falling down. Yet, it is your choice whether you want to scream or enjoy the rest of the ride because you are the one who control your own life. My Journey filled with eventful and unique moments because I have crazy friends, and a lovely family</p>
        <P class="p1 a3">My own journey started in a city called Ramanathapuram in 4th October 1985.I embarked on a career path in teaching, initially working as a teacher. Early experience provided valuable insights into the industry and fueled my desire to further specialize in teaching .Through hard work and continuous learning, I progressed to a teacher, where I am now able to utilize my expertise to prove myself in teaching field.</P>
        <p class="p1 a4">Beyond my professional life, I am deeply passionate about to write a poem and love to  being a web developer. Here i see my imaginations are shining and sprinkling in every moment and i am very much excite to see that in each second.</p>
